# Frontend (React)

Purpose: a React-based webapp that provides distinct views for mobile (phone app / PWA) and desktop browsers.

Structure:
- `src/views/mobile/` — mobile-first UI components and pages
- `src/views/web/` — richer desktop views and dashboards
- `src/components/` — shared components

Quickstart (dev):
- `cd frontend`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Consider building a companion mobile app (React Native) or a PWA with tailored UI and navigation differences.
