# Privacy & Security

- Design for least data retention; store only events and minimal context unless explicit consent.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS). Use strong device authentication.
- Implement role-based access and auditing for clinicians.
- For any clinical use, follow legal/regulatory frameworks (HIPAA, GDPR) and seek institutional review.
